title: Fears
subtitle: Recommendations to encourage best practices in research software
---

Although the scientific community is used to collaboration, competition is an established practice and drives many decisions on how to share information. It has been a trend to keep data and other research artefacts like software private, even after research results get published. Thus, it is not surprising many developers involved in research do not proactively release software as Open Source (Stodden, n.d.). Though part of the fear might be justified, Open Source Software comes with more advantages than disadvantages, and some fears arise from a misunderstanding of the risks involved. In [this appendix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EvhqaDlC1u2iVfqGv-lvPGOgTM5Gc0zRbe70OhaBcqM/edit?usp=sharing) we aim to expose some of the common fear scenarios related to open sourcing and some ways to handle them. These scenarios have been grouped into two sections. The first one collects hypothetical fears of principal investigators including other managerial positions involved in the decision making of how software is developed. The second section includes hypothetical fears of software developers.
