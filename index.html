  <h2>1. Develop publicly accessible open source code from day one</h2>
  <p class='recommendations'>Start a project as open source from the very first day, in a publicly accessible, version controlled repository (e.g., github.com and bitbucket.org). The longer a project is run in a closed manner, the harder it is to open source it later.</p>

  <h2>2. Make software easy to discover by providing software metadata via a popular community registry</h2> 
  <p class='recommendations'>Facilitate the discoverability of the open source software projects by registering metadata related to the software in a popular community registry, making your source code more discoverable. Metadata might, include information like the source code location, contributors, license, references and how to cite the software.</p>
    
  <h2>3. Adopt a license and comply with the licence of third-party dependencies</h2>
  <p class='recommendations'>Provide instructions and guidelines for other projects and software to use, modify and redistribute the software and the source code. Adopt a suitable Open Source license, include it in a publicly accessible source code repository, and ensure the software complies with the licenses of all third party dependencies.</p>
  <h2>4. Have a clear and transparent contribution, governance and communication processes</h2>
  <p class='recommendations'>Open sourcing your software does not mean the software has to be developed in a publicly collaborative manner. Although it is desirable, the OSS recommendations do not mandate a strategy for collaborating with the community. However projects should be clear and transparent about how to contribute to them as well as, their governance model, and their communication channels.</p>
