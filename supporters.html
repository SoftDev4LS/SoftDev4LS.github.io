We welcome individuals, organisations and projects to formally join this initiative and express their support by  selecting the level of adoption of the Open Source Software recommendations:
<ul>
<br/>
<li><h4>Endorsement</h4>
Agreeing to support the OSS recommendations without a formal process for implementation.</li>

<li><h4>Promotion</h4>
Actively publicising and incentivising the OSS recommendations within the organisation as well as globally.</li>

<li><h4>Compliance</h4>
Formally implement them within the organisation, with ongoing monitoring and public reporting if possible. To facilitate progress, we propose that organisations, projects, journals, as well as funding agencies include these OSS recommendations as part of their policies relating to the development and publication of software.</li>
</ul>
