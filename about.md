subtitle: Better software, better research
---

Scientific research relies on computer software, yet software is not always developed following practices that ensure its quality and sustainability. This manuscript does not aim to propose new software development best practices, but rather to provide simple recommendations encouraging the adoption of existing onesbest practices. Software best practices promote better software, and better software improves the reproducibility and reusability of research. These recommendations are designed around Open Source values, and provide practical suggestions that contribute to making research software and its source code more discoverable, reusable and transparent. This manuscript is aimed at developers, but more importantly, it is aimed at organisations, projects, journals and funders that can increase the quality and sustainability of research software by adopting these recommendations.
