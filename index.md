### 1. Develop publicly accessible open source code from day one
Start a project as open source from the very first day, in a publicly accessible, version controlled repository (e.g., github.com and bitbucket.org). The longer a project is run in a closed manner, the harder it is to open source it later.

### 2. Make software easy to discover by providing software metadata via a popular community registry
Facilitate the discoverability of the open source software projects by registering metadata related to the software in a popular community registry, making your source code more discoverable. Metadata might, include information like the source code location, contributors, license, references and how to cite the software.
    
### 3. Adopt a license and comply with the licence of third-party dependencies
Provide instructions and guidelines for other projects and software to use, modify and redistribute the software and the source code. Adopt a suitable Open Source license, include it in a publicly accessible source code repository, and ensure the software complies with the licenses of all third party dependencies.

### 4. Have a clear and transparent contribution, governance and communication processes
Open sourcing your software does not mean the software has to be developed in a publicly collaborative manner. Although it is desirable, the OSS recommendations do not mandate a strategy for collaborating with the community. However projects should be clear and transparent about how to contribute to them as well as, their governance model, and their communication channels.
